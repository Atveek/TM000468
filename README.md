# Our project is Coach Management System

> ## Project Description

   In-School and DLSS are the two crucial grassroots development programs initiated by the Sports Authority of Gujarat. As a part of the program, the coaches deployed in various schools and colleges implement various programs and their subsequent modules crucial for the development of studentathletes. This calls for management or monitoring tools that will help in closely tracking the implementation of the program to ensure successful outcomes envisioned are achieved. The proposed application/ portal should track the progress of programs across districts and should also help in tracking and recording the attendance of the coaches.
